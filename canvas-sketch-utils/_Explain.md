All of these functions are borrowed from package:

[canvas-sketch-util](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch-util)

by

<https://github.com/mattdesl>

I couldn't use them directly in react three fiber because they lack typescript support so I copied functions and corrected typescript errors

edit:

**Deprecated**, plumpnation wrote a package for types:

<https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas-sketch-util-types>
